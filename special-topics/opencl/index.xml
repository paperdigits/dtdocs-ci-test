      <description>Processing high resolution images is a demanding task needing a modern computer. Both in terms of memory requirements and CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 Megapixel image can quickly take your computer to its limits.
darktable&amp;rsquo;s requirements are no exception. All calculations are performed on 4 x 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than “ordinary” 8 or 16 bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.</description>

      <description>As you can imagine, the hardware architecture of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different manufacturers, and even different generations of GPUs from the same manufacturer may not be comparable. At the same time GPU manufacturers don&amp;rsquo;t normally disclose all the hardware details of their products to the public. One of the consequences of this is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your graphics card.</description>

      <title>activating opencl in darktable</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/activate-opencl/</link>

      <description>Using OpenCL in darktable requires that your PC is equipped with a suitable graphics card and that it has the required libraries in place. Most modern graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD come with full OpenCL support. The OpenCL compiler is normally shipped as part of the proprietary graphics driver and is used as a dynamic library called libOpenCL.so. This library must be in a folder where it can be found by your system&amp;rsquo;s dynamic linker.</description>

      <description>The huge diversity of systems and the marked differences between OpenCL vendors and driver versions makes it impossible to give an comprehensive overview of how to setup OpenCL. We only can give you an example, in this case for NVIDIA driver version 331.89 on Ubuntu 14.04. We hope that this will serve you as a first impression and will help to solve possible problems of your specific setup.
The principle OpenCL function flow is like this:</description>

      <description>darktable will detect OpenCL run-time errors automatically. On detecting an error, it will then reprocess everything on the CPU. While this will slow down processing it should not affect the end result.
There can be various reasons why OpenCL might fail during the initialization phase. OpenCL depends on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker model and revision number.</description>

      <title>amd/ati devices</title>

      <description>While NVIDIA devices and most modern AMD/ATI devices will often run out of the box, there is more to do for older AMD/ATI graphics cards, namely those prior to the HD7xxx series. This starts with the fact that those devices will only report part of their total GPU memory to darktable. For a 1GB device this typically amounts to only 512MB, a value which darktable in its standard configuration will refuse as insufficient.</description>

      <title>performance optimization</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/performance/</link>

      <description>There are a number of configuration parameters in $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc that can help to finetune your system&amp;rsquo;s OpenCL performance. Performance in this context mostly means the latency of darktable during interactive work, i.e. how long it takes to reprocess the pixelpipe. For a comfortable workflow it is essential to keep latency low.
In order to obtain profiling info you need to start darktable from a terminal with darktable -d opencl -d perf.</description>

      <title>scheduling profile</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/scheduling-profile/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/scheduling-profile/</guid>
      <description>darktable can use the CPU and one or several OpenCL capable GPUs. Depending on the relative performance of these devices, users can choose among certain scheduling profiles to optimize performance. This is achieved by setting the configuration parameter preferences &amp;gt; cpu/gpu/memory &amp;gt; OpenCL scheduling profile which offers the following choices:
 default If an OpenCL capable GPU is found darktable uses it for processing the center image view while the navigation preview window is processed on the CPU in parallel.</description>

      <title>multiple devices</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/multiple-devices/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/multiple-devices/</guid>
      <description>The scheduling of OpenCL devices on most systems can be optimized using the “OpenCL scheduling profile” settings. However, if your system is equipped with more than one GPU you might want to set the relative device priority manually. To do this you need to select the “default” scheduling profile and change the settings in the “opencl_device_priority” configuration parameter.
It is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image – to convert an input to the final output using a history stack – is run in a pixelpipe.</description>

      <title>opencl still does not run for me</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/still-doesnt-work/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/still-doesnt-work/</guid>
      <description>As has been mentioned, OpenCL systems come with a huge variety of setups: different GPU manufacturers and models, varying amounts of GPU memory, different drivers, different distributions etc..
Many of the potential problems will only appear with very specific combinations of these factors. As the darktable developers only have access to a small fraction of these variations, please understand that we might not be able to fix your specific problem. There is not much we can do if we are unable to reproduce your issue.</description>
