      <description>darktable-chart is a tool for extracting luminance and color values out of images taken from color reference cards such as IT8.7/1 charts. Its main purpose is to compare a source image (typically a largely unprocessed raw image) to a target image (typically a JPEG image created in-camera) and produce a darktable style that is able to use the luminance and color values of the source image to produce the target image.</description>

      <description>The tool is organized into three tabs in the upper part and a text output frame in the lower part.
  The first tab is used to define the source image, the second tab defines the reference (target) and the third tab contains the controls to generate the resulting darktable style.</description>

      <description>In the “source image” tab you set your source image, which requires two elements. The first element is an input file in Lab Portable Float Map format (extension .pfm). The source file represents the largely unmodified data as the camera sees it. Information about how to take photos of a color reference card and produce a .pfm output file are described below. The second element is a chart file that contains a formal description of the underlying color reference card&amp;rsquo;s layout (extension .</description>

      <description>The “reference values” tab determines the target values to which the source image must to be modified by the resulting style. You can either supply reference values in the form of measured data of your color reference card (mode “cie/it8 file”), or you can supply a photographic image (mode “color chart image”) much in the same way as described above. This second image must also be supplied in Lab Portable Float Map format.</description>

      <description>If all of the required settings in the “source image” and “reference values” tabs are ready you can move on to the “process” tab.
  First, you need to tell darktable-chart which of the patches represents the gray ramp. In the screenshot displayed above, the gray ramp is positioned in the lower part of the color reference chart, denoted as “GS00&amp;hellip;GS23”.
The “number of final patches” input defines how many editable color patches the resulting style will use within the color look up table module.</description>

      <description>To start with, you need a suitable photo of your color reference card in RAW+JPEG format. It goes beyond the scope of this manual to explain the details of how to take this photo, but in a nutshell you need to make the shot on a sunny day around midday with the light source (the sun) shining at an angle onto the card. You need to avoid any glare in the image.</description>
