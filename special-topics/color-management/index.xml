      <description>darktable employs a fully color managed workflow:
  Input color specifications are taken from embedded or user-supplied ICC profiles or &amp;ndash; in the case of raw files &amp;ndash; from a library of camera-specific color matrices.
  darktable automatically reads the display profile of your monitor (if properly configured) for accurate on-screen color rendition. Multi-screen setups are fully supported as long as a system service like colord is in place and properly set up to inform darktable of the correct monitor profile.</description>

      <description>For darktable to faithfully render colors on screen it needs to find the correct display profile for your monitor. In general this requires your monitor to be properly calibrated and profiled, and it needs the profile to be correctly installed on your system. darktable queries your X display server&amp;rsquo;s xatom as well as the system service colord (if available) for the right profile. If required you can enforce a specific method in preferences &amp;gt; miscellaneous.</description>

      <description>darktable can render colors either with its internal algorithms or by using the external library LittleCMS2. darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal method is, by an order of magnitude, faster than the external one. The external option gives you a choice of the rendering intent and might offer a slightly higher accuracy in some cases.
You can change the default method in preferences &amp;gt; processing &amp;gt; always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile</description>

      <description>If rendering with LittleCMS2 is activated (see rendering method) you can define how out-of-gamut colors are handled when converting between color spaces. A selection box in the export module, the output color profile module, and soft proof gives you a choice of the following rendering intents:
 perceptual Suited to photographs as it maintains the relative position of colors. This is usually the best choice. relative colorimetric Out-of-gamut colors are converted to colors having the same lightness, but different saturation.</description>

      <title>darktable&#39;s color spaces</title>

      <description>darktable&amp;rsquo;s input images are either RGB files (like JPEGs or TIFFs) or camera RAWs. Both store visual information as a combination of primary colors (such as red, green and blue) which together describe a light emission to be later recreated by a display.
The following image illustrates this concept.
  On the left-hand-side of the image is a colored light that we need to represent digitally. Using three ideal color filters, we can decompose this light into three colored primary lights at different intensities.</description>

      <title>unbounded colors</title>

      <description>Screens and most image file formats can only encode RGB intensities confined within a certain range. For example, images encoded on 8 bits can only contain values from 0 to 255, images on 10 bits from 0 to 1023, and so on… Graphic standards postulate that the maximum of that range, no matter its actual value, will always represent the maximum brightness that the display medium is able to render, usually between 100 and 160 Cd/m² (or nits) depending on the actual standard.</description>

      <title>possible color artifacts</title>

      <description>There are some infrequent situations which still can lead to problematic results unless the user takes some action. Some modules in Lab color space, like levels and monochrome, need to rely on the fact that the L channels carries all lightness information, with the a and b channels purely representing chroma and hue. Unbounded colors with negative L values are especially problematic to these modules and can lead to black pixel artifacts.</description>
