      <description>The tethering view allows you to capture images directly into darktable from a connected camera.
To use the tethering feature you need to connect your camera to your PC using a USB cable. Your computer might ask to mount or view the connected camera. Do not mount or view the camera. If your camera is mounted or viewed automatically, you will need to ‚Äúunmount/eject‚Äù the camera before darktable can access it.</description>

      <description>This section contains examples of typical usages of tethering.
üîóstudio setup with screening This is a pretty common use case. You have your studio and subject set up, the camera is connected to your computer and tethering view is active in darktable. You work at the camera and take images. Whenever you like, you can screen the image directly on your computer monitor instead of using the camera LCD for validation.</description>

      <description>This troubleshooting guide will provide you with some steps to verify whether your camera can be used with tethering. This is done using the gphoto2 command-line tools. This is what darktable uses to interface with your camera.
Find your camera port name to use it in the following tests. Usually the port &amp;ldquo;usb:&amp;rdquo; will be enough and therefore is used in these examples.
üîóis your camera detected? The following command will verify that your camera is connected to the computer and detected by gphoto2.</description>
