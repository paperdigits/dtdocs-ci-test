      <title>module header</title>

      <description>At the top of each processing module is the module header.
  Click on the module name to expand the module and display the parameters that control its operation.
By default darktable will only allow one processing module to be expanded at a time &amp;ndash; if you click the header of another module, the previously-opened module&amp;rsquo;s controls are collapsed. If you want to expand more than one module, you may expand further modules by Shift+clicking on the header and all previously expanded modules will remain open.</description>

      <title>multiple instances</title>

      <description>Many of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules can be applied more than once in the pixelpipe. Each instance of a module behaves independently, taking its input from the module below in the pixelpipe delivering its output to the module above.
As with the base instance of a module, all instances can be moved independently within the pixelpipe either by holding Ctrl+Shift while dragging &amp;amp; dropping or by choosing &amp;ldquo;move up&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;move down&amp;rdquo; in the multiple instances drop-down menu.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/darkroom/processing-modules/presets/</guid>
      <description>Presets allow you to store commonly used module settings for future use. Some modules already come with pre-defined presets and you may also define your own. Both internal and user-defined presets can be shown by clicking the presets menu in the module header.
Most of the functionality described here applies to processing modules only. However, presets can also be used with some utility modules. When used with utility modules, the functionality to auto-apply or auto-show presets based on image Exif data is not available.</description>

      <description>ðŸ”—sliders Sliders offer five different methods of interaction, depending on the level of control you require.
 left-click Click anywhere in the slider area to set the value. You can also click and drag to change it. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to aim for the triangle or even the line - you can click anywhere in the entire height of the slider including the label. mouse wheel Hover over the slider with your mouse, then use your mouse wheel to adjust the value.</description>

      <description>Three processing modules (base curve, tone curve and rgb curve) use curves to control the tones in the image. These modules have some common features that deserve separate discussion.
  ðŸ”—nodes In their default state, curves are straight lines, defined by two anchor nodes at the top-right and bottom-left of the curve graph. You can move the nodes to modify the curve or generate new nodes by clicking on the curve.</description>

      <title>wavelets</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/darkroom/processing-modules/wavelets/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/darkroom/processing-modules/wavelets/</guid>
      <description>Wavelets are a technique used in image processing to separate (or decompose) an image into a number of distinct layers, each containing a different level of detail. After decomposing an image in this way, a module can limit its processing to one or more of these detail layers, and then piece the layers back together again at the end to form its output image. This allows us to be surgical about which features in the image we wish to impact when working with a module.</description>
