      <description>The map view is where you geo-tag your images.
Map view shows a world map with the currently open image or film roll of images, pinned to their geo-tagged location. This requires that the image was geo-tagged by a camera with that feature. Some newer cameras, including smartphones, are already equipped with GPS receivers. Other cameras may need additional GPS hardware to do this.
Even if your camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this feature, there is an alternative method &amp;ndash; darktable can match the Exif time and date data in your image(s) to a separate GPX data tracking file created by a GPS tracker recording your movements.</description>
