      <description>The darktable binary starts darktable with its GUI and full functionality. This is the standard way to use darktable.
darktable can called with the following command line parameters:
darktable [-d {all,cache,camctl,camsupport,control,dev, fswatch,input,lighttable,lua,masks,memory,nan, opencl,perf,pwstorage,print,sql,ioporder, imageio,undo,signal}] [&amp;lt;input file&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;image folder&amp;gt;] [--version] [--disable-opencl] [--library &amp;lt;library file&amp;gt;] [--datadir &amp;lt;data directory&amp;gt;] [--moduledir &amp;lt;module directory&amp;gt;] [--tmpdir &amp;lt;tmp directory&amp;gt;] [--configdir &amp;lt;user config directory&amp;gt;] [--cachedir &amp;lt;user cache directory&amp;gt;] [--localedir &amp;lt;locale directory&amp;gt;] [--luacmd &amp;lt;lua command&amp;gt;] [--noiseprofiles &amp;lt;noiseprofiles json file&amp;gt;] [--d-signal &amp;lt;signal&amp;gt;] [--d-signal-act &amp;lt;all,raise,connect,disconnect,print-trace&amp;gt;] [--conf &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;] [-t &amp;lt;num openmp threads&amp;gt;] All parameters are optional.</description>

      <description>Photography has a long history of producing monochrome images, and many still enjoy this aspect of photography. While there are some specialised/modified cameras with a truly monochrome sensor, most still use a regular camera to capture a color image, and turn it into a monochrome image during post-processing.
There are two main approaches this conversion:
  A physical approach, where we attempt to simulate how a silver-based photographic film emulsion would react to the light captured at the scene.</description>

      <description>The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a film roll ‚Äì a kind of virtual folder. Whenever you import images from the filesystem, the images are organized in a film roll whose name is derived from the name of their parent folder. Re-importing a folder will add any new images to the existing film roll; images already present in the film roll are not reimported (though the contents of their XMP sidecar files are reloaded into the library database).</description>

      <description>When you want to edit some new images in darktable, the first step is to import them. This will create entries for the imported images in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database so it can keep track of the changes you make to them. There are two main methods for importing images:
 import images from the filesystem You can import a single image or a directory full of images (optionally recursing through subdirectories) from the filesystem.</description>

      <description>At the top of each processing module is the module header.
  Click on the module name to expand the module and display the parameters that control its operation.
By default darktable will only allow one processing module to be expanded at a time &amp;ndash; if you click the header of another module, the previously-opened module&amp;rsquo;s controls are collapsed. If you want to expand more than one module, you may expand further modules by Shift+clicking on the header and all previously expanded modules will remain open.</description>

      <description>Masks allow you to limit the effect of a module so that it only applies to certain parts of the image.
A mask can be regarded as a grayscale image where each pixel has a value between 0 and 1.0 (or between 0% and 100%). This value is used to determine how much a module affects each pixel.
The following sections explain how to construct masks in darktable.</description>

      <description>By default each module takes its input from the preceding module in the pixelpipe, performs its operation on the image data, and hands the output over to the next module in the pixelpipe.
A module&amp;rsquo;s output data can optionally be reprocessed (combined) with its input data before being handed to the next module. This additional processing step is called blending. Input and output data is reprocessed using algorithms called blending operators or blend modes.</description>

      <description>The map view is where you geo-tag your images.
Map view shows a world map with the currently open image or film roll of images, pinned to their geo-tagged location. This requires that the image was geo-tagged by a camera with that feature. Some newer cameras, including smartphones, are already equipped with GPS receivers. Other cameras may need additional GPS hardware to do this.
Even if your camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this feature, there is an alternative method &amp;ndash; darktable can match the Exif time and date data in your image(s) to a separate GPX data tracking file created by a GPS tracker recording your movements.</description>

      <description>darktable employs a fully color managed workflow:
  Input color specifications are taken from embedded or user-supplied ICC profiles or &amp;ndash; in the case of raw files &amp;ndash; from a library of camera-specific color matrices.
  darktable automatically reads the display profile of your monitor (if properly configured) for accurate on-screen color rendition. Multi-screen setups are fully supported as long as a system service like colord is in place and properly set up to inform darktable of the correct monitor profile.</description>

      <description>darktable-chart is a tool for extracting luminance and color values out of images taken from color reference cards such as IT8.7/1 charts. Its main purpose is to compare a source image (typically a largely unprocessed raw image) to a target image (typically a JPEG image created in-camera) and produce a darktable style that is able to use the luminance and color values of the source image to produce the target image.</description>

      <description>darktable is a non-destructive image editor and opens all images in read-only mode. Any data created within darktable (metadata, tags, and image processing steps) are stored in separate .XMP sidecar files. These files allow darktable to store information about the images as well as the full editing history without touching the original raw files. When you import an image into darktable for the first time, an XMP file is automatically generated (XMP generation can be disabled in preferences &amp;gt; storage but this is not recommended in normal use).</description>

      <description>The basic element of image processing in darktable is the processing module. In order to process a raw image a number of such modules act on the input image in sequence, each performing a different operation on the image data. For those familiar with Adobe Photoshop, the concept of a processing module in darktable is analagous to that of an adjustment layer in that both make an incremental adjustment to the image, building on top of the adjustments that came before.</description>

      <description>Processing high resolution images is a demanding task needing a modern computer. Both in terms of memory requirements and CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 Megapixel image can quickly take your computer to its limits.
darktable&amp;rsquo;s requirements are no exception. All calculations are performed on 4 x 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than ‚Äúordinary‚Äù 8 or 16 bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.</description>

      <description>Blend modes define how the input and output of a module are combined (blended) together before a module&amp;rsquo;s final output is passed to the next module in the pixelpipe.
Classic blending modes, designed for display-referred RGB (constrained to 0-100%) implicitly define a fulcrum at 50% (gray) or 100% (white) in their algorithms, depending on the blend mode. Because scene-referred is not subject to these restrictions, this fulcrum needs to be explicitly defined by the user when performing blending operations in the &amp;ldquo;RGB (scene)&amp;rdquo; color space.</description>

      <description>The darktable-cli binary starts the command line interface variant of darktable which allows images to be exported.
This variant does not open any display &amp;ndash; it works in pure console mode without launching a GUI. This mode is particularly useful for servers running background jobs.
darktable-cli can be called with the following command line parameters:
darktable-cli [&amp;lt;input file or folder&amp;gt;] [&amp;lt;xmp file&amp;gt;] &amp;lt;output file or folder&amp;gt; [--width &amp;lt;max width&amp;gt;] [--height &amp;lt;max height&amp;gt;] [--bpp &amp;lt;bpp&amp;gt;] [--hq &amp;lt;0|1|true|false&amp;gt;] [--upscale &amp;lt;0|1|true|false&amp;gt;] [--style &amp;lt;style name&amp;gt;] [--style-overwrite] [--apply-custom-presets &amp;lt;0|1|false|true&amp;gt;] [--out-ext &amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;] [--import &amp;lt;file or dir&amp;gt;] [--icc-type &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;] [--icc-file &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;] [--icc-intent &amp;lt;intent&amp;gt;] [--verbose] [--help [option]] [--core &amp;lt;darktable options&amp;gt;] The user must supply an input filename and an output filename.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/color-management/display-profile/</guid>
      <description>For darktable to faithfully render colors on screen it needs to find the correct display profile for your monitor. In general this requires your monitor to be properly calibrated and profiled, and it needs the profile to be correctly installed on your system. darktable queries your X display server&amp;rsquo;s xatom as well as the system service colord (if available) for the right profile. If required you can enforce a specific method in preferences &amp;gt; miscellaneous.</description>

      <description>With the drawn mask feature you can construct a mask by drawing shapes directly onto the image canvas. Shapes can be used alone or in combination. Once a shape has been drawn on an image it can be adjusted, removed, or reused in other modules.
Shapes are stored internally as vector graphics and are rendered with the required resolution during pixelpipe processing. Shapes are expressed in the coordinate system of the original image and are transformed along with the rest of the image by any active distorting modules in the pipe (lens correction, crop &amp;amp; rotate for example).</description>

      <description>This section will guide you through the basics of developing an image in the darkroom view, where an arsenal of modules is at hand to help you reach your creative goals.
To begin, open an image in the darkroom by double clicking an image thumbnail in the lighttable view.
Each change you make to the image in the darkroom is turned into a history stack item. The history is stored in a database and in an XMP sidecar file for that image.</description>

      <description>As you can imagine, the hardware architecture of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different manufacturers, and even different generations of GPUs from the same manufacturer may not be comparable. At the same time GPU manufacturers don&amp;rsquo;t normally disclose all the hardware details of their products to the public. One of the consequences of this is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your graphics card.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/overview/sidecar-files/sidecar-import/</guid>
      <description>When importing an image, darktable automatically checks if it is accompanied by a sidecar file. As well as looking for files named &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp and &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;_nn.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp (darktable&amp;rsquo;s XMP file naming formats) darktable also checks for the presence of a file in the form &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.xmp (the naming format for Lighroom&amp;rsquo;s XMP sidecar files). Files with the latter naming format will be read by darktable but will not be written to. Once the image has been imported, darktable will generate an additional XMP file using its own naming convention.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/memory/</guid>
      <description>darktable&amp;rsquo;s memory requirements are high. A simple calculation makes this clear. If you have a 20MPx image then, for precision reasons, darktable will store this internally as a 4 x 32-bit floating point cell for each pixel. Each full image of this size will therefore need about 300MB of memory. As we want to process the image, we will at least need two buffers for each module ‚Äì one for input and one for output.</description>

      <description>Many of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules can be applied more than once in the pixelpipe. Each instance of a module behaves independently, taking its input from the module below in the pixelpipe delivering its output to the module above.
As with the base instance of a module, all instances can be moved independently within the pixelpipe either by holding Ctrl+Shift while dragging &amp;amp; dropping or by choosing &amp;ldquo;move up&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;move down&amp;rdquo; in the multiple instances drop-down menu.</description>

print(&amp;quot;Hello World !&amp;quot;) Start darktable and you will see the sentence &amp;ldquo;Hello World !&amp;rdquo; printed on the console. Nothing fancy but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.
At this point, there is nothing darktable-specific in the script. We simply use Lua&amp;rsquo;s standard print function to print a string.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/overview/workflow/edit-scene-referred/</guid>
      <description>The scene-referred workflow places an emphasis on performing image processing in the linear scene-referred part of the pixelpipe. This helps to reduce artifacts and color shifts that can result from processing non-linear pixel values and, by decoupling the image processing from the characteristics of a specific display, it makes it easier to adapt your work in the future to new display media, such as high dynamic range displays.
This being the recommended way to process images in versions 3.</description>

      <description>Many users have huge image collections stored on extra hard drives in their desktop computer, or on an external storage medium like a RAID NAS, etc.
It is a common requirement to be able to develop a number of images while travelling using a laptop and then later synchronize them back to the original storage medium. However, copying images manually from the main storage to the laptop and back is cumbersome and prone to errors.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/darkroom/masking-and-blending/masks/parametric/</guid>
      <description>The parametric mask feature offers fine-grained selective control over how individual pixels are masked. It does this by automatically generating an intermediate blend mask from user-defined parameters. These parameters are color coordinates rather than the geometrical coordinates used in drawn masks.
For each data channel of a module (Lab, RGB) and several virtual data channels (e.g. hue, saturation) you can construct a per-channel opacity function. Depending on each pixel&amp;rsquo;s value for a given data channel this function calculates a blending factor between 0 and 1 (100%) for that pixel.</description>

      <description>Presets allow you to store commonly used module settings for future use. Some modules already come with pre-defined presets and you may also define your own. Both internal and user-defined presets can be shown by clicking the presets menu in the module header.
Most of the functionality described here applies to processing modules only. However, presets can also be used with some utility modules. When used with utility modules, the functionality to auto-apply or auto-show presets based on image Exif data is not available.</description>

      <description>darktable can render colors either with its internal algorithms or by using the external library LittleCMS2. darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal method is, by an order of magnitude, faster than the external one. The external option gives you a choice of the rendering intent and might offer a slightly higher accuracy in some cases.
You can change the default method in preferences &amp;gt; processing &amp;gt; always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile</description>

      <description>This is a legacy mode which is retained to provide backward-compatibility with edits in older darktable versions, and to allows users to continue with their former way of working without forcing them to use the newer scene-referred workflow.
The display-referred workflow places more emphasis on performing image processing in the non-linear display-referred part of the pixelpipe. By default it uses the base curve module to tone map images from the linear scene-referred space into display-referred space, although other tone-mapping tools (such as the tone curve module) can also be used.</description>

      <description>darktable&amp;rsquo;s input images are either RGB files (like JPEGs or TIFFs) or camera RAWs. Both store visual information as a combination of primary colors (such as red, green and blue) which together describe a light emission to be later recreated by a display.
The following image illustrates this concept.
  On the left-hand-side of the image is a colored light that we need to represent digitally. Using three ideal color filters, we can decompose this light into three colored primary lights at different intensities.</description>

      <description>Changes to an image are not saved directly to the image file contrary to a regular image editor. Rather, darktable is a non-destructive editor, which means that all changes are recorded in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database, and the original image is left untouched. Therefore, you need to export images in order to bake your processing options and metadata changes into an output file that can be distributed outside of darktable.
Images are exported using the export module which is available in the lighttable and darkroom views.</description>

      <description>Grouping images helps to improve the structure and clarity of your image collection when displayed in lighttable view.
You can combine images into a group by selecting them and clicking the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù button in the selected image(s) module, or by pressing Ctrl+G. Likewise, you can remove selected images from a group by clicking the ‚Äúungroup‚Äù button, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G. Images generated by duplicating an existing image are automatically grouped. Similarly, if you import multiple images with the same base name, but different extensions (eg.</description>

      <description>darktable will detect OpenCL run-time errors automatically. On detecting an error, it will then reprocess everything on the CPU. While this will slow down processing it should not affect the end result.
There can be various reasons why OpenCL might fail during the initialization phase. OpenCL depends on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker model and revision number.</description>

  First, you need to tell darktable-chart which of the patches represents the gray ramp. In the screenshot displayed above, the gray ramp is positioned in the lower part of the color reference chart, denoted as ‚ÄúGS00&amp;hellip;GS23‚Äù.
The ‚Äúnumber of final patches‚Äù input defines how many editable color patches the resulting style will use within the color look up table module.</description>

      <description>Wavelets are a technique used in image processing to separate (or decompose) an image into a number of distinct layers, each containing a different level of detail. After decomposing an image in this way, a module can limit its processing to one or more of these detail layers, and then piece the layers back together again at the end to form its output image. This allows us to be surgical about which features in the image we wish to impact when working with a module.</description>

      <description>While NVIDIA devices and most modern AMD/ATI devices will often run out of the box, there is more to do for older AMD/ATI graphics cards, namely those prior to the HD7xxx series. This starts with the fact that those devices will only report part of their total GPU memory to darktable. For a 1GB device this typically amounts to only 512MB, a value which darktable in its standard configuration will refuse as insufficient.</description>

      <description>So far we have learned to use lua to adapt darktable to our particular workflow. Let&amp;rsquo;s look now at how to use lua to easily export images to an online service. If you are able to upload an image to a service via the command line then you can use lua to integrate this into darktable&amp;rsquo;s user interface.
In this next example we will use lua to export via scp. A new storage type will appear in darktable&amp;rsquo;s UI which will export images to a remote target via the copy mechanism in ssh.</description>

      <description>To start with, you need a suitable photo of your color reference card in RAW+JPEG format. It goes beyond the scope of this manual to explain the details of how to take this photo, but in a nutshell you need to make the shot on a sunny day around midday with the light source (the sun) shining at an angle onto the card. You need to avoid any glare in the image.</description>

      <description>darktable allows you to store additional information about your images to allow them to be more easily searched and grouped. This information is stored in darktable&amp;rsquo;s database and XMP sidecar files and can also be included within exported images.
üîómetadata Metadata (e.g. title, description) is free-format text that usually differs for each image.
See the metadata editor module for details of how to add metadata to images.
üîótagging Tags are usually shared between multiple images and are used to categorise and group them.</description>

      <description>As described in the previous sections, the final output of a module&amp;rsquo;s mask (the combined effect of any drawn and parameteric masks) is a grayscale raster image representing the extent to which the module&amp;rsquo;s effect should be applied to each pixel. This raster image is stored internally for active modules and can be subsequently reused within other modules in the pixelpipe.
As with any mask, if the value for a pixel in a raster mask is zero the input to the module is passed in the module&amp;rsquo;s output unchanged.</description>

      <description>Screens and most image file formats can only encode RGB intensities confined within a certain range. For example, images encoded on 8 bits can only contain values from 0 to 255, images on 10 bits from 0 to 1023, and so on‚Ä¶ Graphic standards postulate that the maximum of that range, no matter its actual value, will always represent the maximum brightness that the display medium is able to render, usually between 100 and 160 Cd/m¬≤ (or nits) depending on the actual standard.</description>

      <description>Our previous example was a bit limited. In particular the use of a preference for the export path wasn&amp;rsquo;t very nice. We can do better than that by adding elements to the user interface in the export dialog.
UI elements are created via the darktable_new_widget function. This function takes a type of widget as a parameter and returns a new object corresponding to that widget. You can then set various fields in that widget to set its parameters.</description>

      <description>There are a number of configuration parameters in $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc that can help to finetune your system&amp;rsquo;s OpenCL performance. Performance in this context mostly means the latency of darktable during interactive work, i.e. how long it takes to reprocess the pixelpipe. For a comfortable workflow it is essential to keep latency low.
In order to obtain profiling info you need to start darktable from a terminal with darktable -d opencl -d perf.</description>

      <description>There are some infrequent situations which still can lead to problematic results unless the user takes some action. Some modules in Lab color space, like levels and monochrome, need to rely on the fact that the L channels carries all lightness information, with the a and b channels purely representing chroma and hue. Unbounded colors with negative L values are especially problematic to these modules and can lead to black pixel artifacts.</description>

      <description>The following options control how images are processed.
 always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases.  If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this configuration parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>

      <description>Most image processing applications come from the 1990s and/or inherit a 1990s workflow. These applications processed images encoded with 8 bit unsigned integers because it was more memory and computationally efficient. However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a &amp;ldquo;gamma&amp;rdquo; (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details).</description>

 memory in megabytes to use for thumbnail cache In order to speed-up the display of film rolls, darktable stores image thumbnails in a cache file on disk (primary cache) and loads it into memory at startup. This setting controls the size of the cache in megabytes. It needs a restart if changed (default 256MB). enable disk backend for thumbnail cache If activated, darktable stores all thumbnails on disk as a secondary cache, and thereby keeps thumbnails accessible if they get dropped from the primary cache.</description>

      <description>The scheduling of OpenCL devices on most systems can be optimized using the ‚ÄúOpenCL scheduling profile‚Äù settings. However, if your system is equipped with more than one GPU you might want to set the relative device priority manually. To do this you need to select the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù scheduling profile and change the settings in the ‚Äúopencl_device_priority‚Äù configuration parameter.
It is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image ‚Äì to convert an input to the final output using a history stack ‚Äì is run in a pixelpipe.</description>

      <description>As has been mentioned, OpenCL systems come with a huge variety of setups: different GPU manufacturers and models, varying amounts of GPU memory, different drivers, different distributions etc..
Many of the potential problems will only appear with very specific combinations of these factors. As the darktable developers only have access to a small fraction of these variations, please understand that we might not be able to fix your specific problem. There is not much we can do if we are unable to reproduce your issue.</description>

The lua interface allows you to use darktable from any lua script. This will load darktable as a library and provide you with most of the lua API (darktable is configured headless, so the functions relating to the user interface are not available).
As an example, the following program will print the list of all images in your library:</description>

      <description>Remove image noise while preserving structure.
This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity.
As denoising is a resource-intensive process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly. Consider activating this module late in your workflow.</description>

As this module operates on non-demosaiced raw data, the underlying model assumes an uncropped photographic image as input. It is therefore likely to fail when you zoom in, as it is only able to operate on the visible portion of the image. The module will therefore be bypassed at high zoom levels, and a &amp;ldquo;bypassed&amp;rdquo; message will appear at the top of the module. This limitation only applies to interactive work and not to the final export.</description>

      <description>When an image is sent to a display device, each pixel is normally represented as a set of 3 numbers, representing the intensity of the red, green and blue primary colors in the output color space. Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space. Similarly, there is also a minimum value below which pixel values will be mapped to zero.</description>

If an image is displayed against a dark background, as with the default theme in darktable, it can have the a number of adverse effects on our perception of that image:
 Exaggeration of the perceived exposure makes the image seems brighter than it really is. This is nicely illustrated by the Adelson checkerboard shadow effect.</description>

  To adjust the white balance (chromatic adaptation), working in tandem with the white balance module. In this case, the white balance module performs an initial white balance step (which is still required in order for the demosaic module to work effectively). The color calibration module then calculates a more perceptually-accurate white balance after the input color profile has been applied.</description>

üîóbayer filters The sensor cells of a digital camera are not color-sensitive &amp;ndash; they are only able to record different levels of lightness. In order to obtain a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter (red, green or blue) that primarily passes light of that color. This means that each pixel of the raw image only contains information about a single color channel.</description>

      <description>An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the noise profiles of specific camera sensors.
One issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera&amp;rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.</description>

      <description>This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export.
Although not an inherent problem in any of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the vignetting or graduated density modules.</description>

      <description>The input color profile module defines how darktable will interpret the colors of the image. It takes the color space used by the source of the image (e.g. camera, scanner) and converts the pixel encodings to a standardised working color space. This means that subsequent modules in the pipeline don&amp;rsquo;t need to be concerned with the specifics of the input device, and can work with and convert to/from the working color space.</description>

      <description>Simulate human lowlight vision making pictures look closer to human lowlight perception. This module can also be used to perform a day-to-night conversion.
The idea is to calculate a scotopic vision image, which is perceived by the rods rather than than the cones in the eyes under low light. Scotopic lightness is then mixed with photopic value (regular color image pixel) using some blending function. This module is also able to simulate the Purkinje effect by adding some blueness to the dark parts of the image.</description>

      <description>Automatically correct for converging lines, a form of perspective distortion. The underlying mechanism is inspired by Markus Hebel&amp;rsquo;s ShiftN program.
Perspective distortions are a natural effect when projecting a three dimensional scene onto a two dimensional plane and cause objects close to the viewer to appear larger than objects further away. Converging lines are a special case of perspective distortions frequently seen in architectural photographs. Parallel lines, when photographed at an angle, are transformed into converging lines that meet at some vantage point within or outside of the image frame.</description>

      <description>Remove unwanted image elements by cloning, healing, blurring and filling using drawn shapes.
This module extends the capabilities of the spot removal module by including a &amp;ldquo;heal&amp;rdquo; tool (based on the heal tool from GIMP) which provides a type of seamless cloning. It can also take advantage of wavelet decomposition, allowing the image to be separated into layers of varying detail (from coarse to fine). These layers can then be selectively retouched before being recombined to produce the output image.</description>

      <description>The sensors of some cameras (such as the Fujifilm FinePix S2Pro, F700, and E550) have a diagonally oriented Bayer pattern instead of the usual orthogonal layout.
Without correction this would lead to a tilted image with black corners. This module applies the required rotation.
darktable detects images that need correction using their Exif data and automatically activates this module where required. For other images the module always remains disabled.

      <description>Create a softened image using the Orton effect.
Michael Orton achieved his results on slide film by using two exposures of the same scene, one well exposed and one overexposed. He then used a darkroom technique to blend these two images into a final image where the overexposed image was blurred.
This module is a near-copy of Orton&amp;rsquo;s analog process into the digital domain.
