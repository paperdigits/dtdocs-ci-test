      <description>Search for a location on the map. You must be connected to the internet to use this feature.
To use this module, type in a place name or address, press Enter and a list of results will be shown. Click on one of the resulting items and the map will zoom to that location. An outline covering that location or a pin pointing at the location will be displayed. Drag images from the filmstrip at the bottom of the screen to their location on the map.</description>

      <description>Create areas or locations and organize them as hierarchical tags. The pipe ‚Äú|‚Äù character can be used to insert a new level (a group of locations).
A location is shown as a shape on the map when selected. Initially each location will be represented as a square or circle and can be changed to a rectangle or ellipse by adjusting the shape&amp;rsquo;s width and/or height. Each location is stored as tag entry under the geotagging collection.</description>
