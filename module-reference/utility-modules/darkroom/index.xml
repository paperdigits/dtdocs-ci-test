      <title>clipping warning</title>

      <description>When an image is sent to a display device, each pixel is normally represented as a set of 3 numbers, representing the intensity of the red, green and blue primary colors in the output color space. Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space. Similarly, there is also a minimum value below which pixel values will be mapped to zero.</description>

      <title>color assessment</title>

      <description>When developing an image, the way we perceive brightness, contrast and saturation is influenced by the surrounding ambient conditions. If an image is displayed against a dark background, as with the default theme in darktable, it can have the a number of adverse effects on our perception of that image:
 Exaggeration of the perceived exposure makes the image seems brighter than it really is. This is nicely illustrated by the Adelson checkerboard shadow effect.</description>

      <title>duplicate manager</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/duplicate-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/duplicate-manager/</guid>
      <description>The duplicate manager lists all versions of the current darkroom image with their preview thumbnails. Hold down the left mouse button on a thumbnail to temporarily show that version in the center view. Double click to switch to this version and edit it.
The buttons on the top-right allow you to create new duplicates of the current image. You can either create a &amp;lsquo;virgin&amp;rsquo; version (with an empty history stack) or an exact duplicate of the current image.</description>

      <title>gamut check</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/gamut/</link>

      <description>Click the icon on the right of the bottom panel to activate the gamut check display mode for your image. This function highlights, in cyan, all pixels that are out of gamut with respect to the selected softproof profile. You can also activate gamut check with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+G. A message “gamut check” on the bottom left of your image tells you that you are in gamut check display mode.</description>

      <title>global color picker</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/global-color-picker/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/global-color-picker/</guid>
      <description>Take color samples from the current darkroom image, display their values in multiple ways and compare colors from different locations.
The color picker is activated by pressing the color picker icon. The module&amp;rsquo;s parameters will remain in effect until you leave the darkroom mode.
Besides the global color picker described here, many darktable modules (e.g. tone curve) also contain local color pickers which are used to set individual module parameters. You should be aware that these two forms of color picker do not always work in the same color space.</description>

      <title>history stack</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/history-stack/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/history-stack/</guid>
      <description>Query and modify the history stack of the current darkroom image.
This module lists every change of state (activate/de-activate/move/change parameters) for all processing modules that have been modified for the current image. You can select a point in the stack to return to that point in the development history of the image.
 Caution: adjusting any module will cause all modules above the currently selected one to be discarded. It is easy to lose development work on an image in this way!</description>

      <title>image information line</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/image-info-line/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/image-info-line/</guid>
      <description>Display information about the current image in a darkroom panel. The contents of this line can be set in preferences &amp;gt; darkroom.
See the variables section for information about the variables that can be used here. You can also insert a newline with $(NL).
The image information line can be displayed in the top, bottom, left or right panel depending on an additional configuration item in preferences &amp;gt; darkroom.</description>

      <title>mask manager</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/mask-manager/</link>

      <description>Manage all masks and shapes for the current image.
  This module can be used to create, rename, edit and delete shapes. You can add shapes to and remove shapes from a mask, group shapes together, and combine them using set operators.
In the top line of the mask manager panel are buttons that can be used to create new shapes. These are the same as in the drawn mask interface of the individual modules.</description>

      <title>module order</title>

      <description>Change the order of the processing modules in the darkroom using presets.
When processing an image, the active modules are applied in a specific order, which is shown in the right-hand panel of the darkroom view. This module provides information about the current ordering of the processing modules in the pixelpipe. The single parameter &amp;ldquo;current order&amp;rdquo; can take on the following values:
 v3.0 This is the default module order for scene-referred workflow.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/navigation/</guid>
      <description>On the top left hand side of the darkroom, the navigation panel displays a full preview of the current image with a rectangle showing the currently visible zoom area in the central panel. Drag the rectangle around to pan the zoomed-in view. The current zoom scale is displayed to the right of the preview image. Click on that figure for a quick access to some common zoom levels.
The navigation panel can be toggled on/off with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+N by default).</description>

      <title>raw overexposed warning</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/raw-overexposed/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/raw-overexposed/</guid>
      <description>This option warns you about areas of your raw input image with clipped color channels. Clipped color channels imply an overexposed image with loss of information in the affected areas. You may use the highlight reconstruction or color reconstruction modules to attempt to reconstruct these areas.
Right-click on the icon to open a dialog containing the following configuration parameters.
 mode Choose how to mark clipped areas:   mark with CFA color: Display a pattern of the respective primary colors (red, green, and blue) to indicate which color channels are clipped.</description>

      <title>snapshots</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/snapshots/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/snapshots/</guid>
      <description>A snapshot is a stored bitmap of the center image in the darktable view. Snapshots can be taken at any point in the development process and later selected to be overlaid onto the current center view. This allows you to undertake a side by side comparison (by default left=snapshot, right=active edit) while you are tuning parameters of a module. This can also be combined with history stack module to compare a snapshot against different stages of development.</description>

Soft proof allows you to preview your image rendered using a printer profile to see how colors will end up on the final print. You can also activate soft proof with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S. A message “soft proof&amp;quot; on the bottom left of your image tells you that you are in soft proof display mode.</description>
