      <description>Filter the images shown in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes. This set of filtered images is known as a collection.
All images imported imported into darktable are stored in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database, along with attributes describing each image. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.</description>

      <description>The focus peaking module allows you to identify which parts of the image are sharp and in-focus. It works both in the lighttable view, where you can easily see at a glance which images are sharp and which are blurry, and in the darkroom view, when you are processing a single image.
The module is activated by clicking on the focus-peaking icon (  ). It highlights the sharp parts of the image with a yellow, green and blue overlay:</description>

Tags provide a means of adding information to images using a keyword dictionary. You can also manage tags as a hierarchical tree, which can be useful when their number becomes large.
Tags are physically stored in XMP sidecar files as well as in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database and can be included in exported images.
üîódefinitions The following definitions assume that you have set up a single tag named &amp;ldquo;places|France|Nord|Lille&amp;rdquo;.</description>
