      <description>Remove image noise while preserving structure.
This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity.
As denoising is a resource-intensive process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly. Consider activating this module late in your workflow.</description>

      <description>Simulate the in-camera JPEG by applying a characteristic base curve to the image.
darktable comes with a number of base curve presets that attempt to mimic the curves of various camera manufacturers. These presets are automatically applied according to the manufacturer ID found in the image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data. Camera-specific base curve presets are also available for some camera models.
This module will be enabled by default if the default pixel workflow is set to &amp;ldquo;display-referred&amp;rdquo; in preferences &amp;gt; processing.</description>

      <description>Please note that this module is deprecated in darktable 3.6 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the quick access panel instead.
 A convenience module that combines controls from exposure, highlight reconstruction, color balance and vibrance into a single module.
While this module can provide a quick and convenient way to make simple adjustments to an image, it must be used with care. Normally exposure adjustments should come before input color profile in the pixelpipe, and color adjustments should come after.</description>

      <description>Correct chromatic aberrations.
As this module operates on non-demosaiced raw data, the underlying model assumes an uncropped photographic image as input. It is therefore likely to fail when you zoom in, as it is only able to operate on the visible portion of the image. The module will therefore be bypassed at high zoom levels, and a &amp;ldquo;bypassed&amp;rdquo; message will appear at the top of the module. This limitation only applies to interactive work and not to the final export.</description>

      <description>A versatile tool for adjusting the image&amp;rsquo;s color balance.
This module can be used to revert parasitic color casts or to enhance the visual atmosphere of an image using color grading, a popular technique in the cinema industry.
🔗overview The color balance module allows you to shift colors selectively by luminance range: shadows, mid-tones, and highlights. It does so using two different methods:
 lift, gamma, gain the classic method, which allows a more separated control of shadows versus highlights.</description>

      <description>A fully-featured color-space correction, white balance adjustment and channel mixer. This simple yet powerful module can be used in the following ways:
  To adjust the white balance (chromatic adaptation), working in tandem with the white balance module. In this case, the white balance module performs an initial white balance step (which is still required in order for the demosaic module to work effectively). The color calibration module then calculates a more perceptually-accurate white balance after the input color profile has been applied.</description>

      <description>Recover color information in blown-out highlights.
Due to the nature of digital sensors, overexposed highlights lack valid color information. Most frequently they appear neutral white or exhibit some color cast &amp;ndash; depending on what other image processing steps are involved. This module can “heal” overexposed highlights by replacing their colors with better fitting ones. The module acts on pixels whose luminance exceeds a user-defined threshold. Replacement colors are taken from neighboring pixels.</description>

🔗bayer filters The sensor cells of a digital camera are not color-sensitive &amp;ndash; they are only able to record different levels of lightness. In order to obtain a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter (red, green or blue) that primarily passes light of that color. This means that each pixel of the raw image only contains information about a single color channel.</description>

      <description>An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the noise profiles of specific camera sensors.
One issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera&amp;rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.</description>

      <description>This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export.
Although not an inherent problem in any of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the vignetting or graduated density modules.</description>

      <description>The input color profile module defines how darktable will interpret the colors of the image. It takes the color space used by the source of the image (e.g. camera, scanner) and converts the pixel encodings to a standardised working color space. This means that subsequent modules in the pipeline don&amp;rsquo;t need to be concerned with the specifics of the input device, and can work with and convert to/from the working color space.</description>

      <description>Simulate human lowlight vision making pictures look closer to human lowlight perception. This module can also be used to perform a day-to-night conversion.
The idea is to calculate a scotopic vision image, which is perceived by the rods rather than than the cones in the eyes under low light. Scotopic lightness is then mixed with photopic value (regular color image pixel) using some blending function. This module is also able to simulate the Purkinje effect by adding some blueness to the dark parts of the image.</description>

      <description>Automatically correct for converging lines, a form of perspective distortion. The underlying mechanism is inspired by Markus Hebel&amp;rsquo;s ShiftN program.
Perspective distortions are a natural effect when projecting a three dimensional scene onto a two dimensional plane and cause objects close to the viewer to appear larger than objects further away. Converging lines are a special case of perspective distortions frequently seen in architectural photographs. Parallel lines, when photographed at an angle, are transformed into converging lines that meet at some vantage point within or outside of the image frame.</description>

      <description>Correct areas of an image (the target) using details from another area of the image (the source).
This module uses some of the shapes that are available for drawn masks (circles, ellipses and paths), and the user interface is similar.
To use this module, first select the desired shape by clicking the corresponding shape icon (Ctrl+click to enable continuous shape creation mode). Next, you may optionally choose the source for the correction by using Shift+Ctrl+click or Shift+click on the image canvas to choose absolute or relative mode, respectively (see below).</description>

      <description>Smooth image surfaces while preserving sharp edges using a bilateral filter.
This module can be used to denoise images, however you should be aware that bilateral filters are susceptible to overshoots and darktable offers much better alternatives. For example, the astrophoto denoise module uses a non-local means denoising algorithm, and the denoise (profiled) module provides a choice between non-local means and wavelet denoising algorithms.
The surface blur module blurs noise within the surfaces of an image by averaging pixels with their neighbors, taking into account not only their geometric distance but also their distance on the range scale (i.</description>

      <description>A classic digital photography tool to alter an image&amp;rsquo;s tones using curves.
This module is very similar to the rgb curve module but works in Lab color space.
Activate the color picker to show the picked values in the histogram (Ctrl+click to use the picker in area mode). Numerical (Lab) values of the input and output (see below) at the selected spot or area are shown at the top left of the widget.</description>

      <description>Perform dodging and burning on an image while preserving local contrast.
This module can selectively brighten or darken up to 9 different ranges of luminosity. When used together with filmic rgb, it replaces the need for other tone-mapping modules such as the base curve, shadows and highlights, tone curve and zone system (deprecated) modules. It works in linear RGB space and uses a mask to guide the dodging and burning adjustments, helping to preserve local contrast within the image.</description>

      <description>Please note that this module is deprecated in darktable 3.4 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the tone equalizer module instead.
 Compress the tonal range of HDR images so that they fit into the limits of an LDR image, using Durand&amp;rsquo;s 2002 algorithm.
The underlying algorithm uses a bilateral filter to decompose an image into a coarse base layer and a detail layer. The contrast of the base layer is compressed, while the detail layer is preserved, then both layers are re-combined.</description>

      <description>Add a correction curve to image data. This is required if you have selected certain input profiles in the input color profile module.
If you decide to use an ICC profile from the camera manufacturer in the input color profile module, a correction curve frequently needs to be pre-applied to image data to prevent the final output from looking too dark. This extra processing is not required if you use darktable&amp;rsquo;s standard or enhanced color matrices.</description>

      <description>Apply a vignetting effect to the image.
Vignetting is a modification of the brightness and saturation at the borders of the image in a specified shape. Many of the parameters listed below can also be modified with a graphical control that overlays the image when the module has focus, showing the shape and extent of the effect.
 Note: This module is known to provoke banding artifacts under certain conditions. You should consider activating the dithering module to alleviate this.</description>

      <description>Render a vector-based overlay onto your image. Watermarks are standard SVG documents and can be designed using Inkscape.
The SVG processor of darktable can also substitute strings within the SVG document, which allows you to include image dependent information in the watermark.
User-designed watermarks should be placed into the directory $HOME/.config/darktable/watermarks. Once in place, use the reload button update the list of available watermarks.
The following is a list of variable strings that are supported for substitution within the SVG document.</description>

      <description>Adjust the white balance of the image by altering the temperature and tint, defining a coefficient for each (RGB) channel, or choosing from list of predefined white balance settings.
The default settings for this module are derived from the camera white balance stored in the image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data.
White balance is not intended as a &amp;ldquo;creative&amp;rdquo; module &amp;ndash; its primary goal is is to technically correct the white balance of the image ensuring that neutral colored objects in the scene are rendered as neutral colors in the image.</description>
