      <description>darktable comes with a number of user-configurable preferences. These can be adjusted in the preferences dialog, which can be reached by clicking the gear icon on the right of the top panel. Preferences are separated into tabs, each of which is described in more detail in the following sections.
When opened from within the lighttable or darkroom views, the appropriate tab will be loaded by default to allow you to modify that view&amp;rsquo;s settings.</description>

      <description>The preferences in this tab control the overall look and feel of darktable.
 interface language Set the language of the user interface. The system default is marked with an * (needs a restart) theme Set the theme for the user interface. Apart from any aesthetic considerations, the recommended interface color for color evaluation is middle gray. Indeed, visual perception is affected by ambient brightness, and a low brightness of the interface causes all kinds of illusions.</description>

      <description>This tab contains a number of default settings for the lighttable import module.
üîósession options These options define a naming pattern to organize images on disk when importing from a connected camera and when taking photos in the tethering view.
The naming pattern consists of three parts: a base part defining the parent folder, a session part defining a sub directory (which is specific to the individual import session), and a file name part defining the filename structure for each imported image.</description>

      <description>The following options control how images are processed.
 always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases.  If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this configuration parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>

      <description>This preference tab contains mostly performance-related settings:
 memory in megabytes to use for thumbnail cache In order to speed-up the display of film rolls, darktable stores image thumbnails in a cache file on disk (primary cache) and loads it into memory at startup. This setting controls the size of the cache in megabytes. It needs a restart if changed (default 256MB). enable disk backend for thumbnail cache If activated, darktable stores all thumbnails on disk as a secondary cache, and thereby keeps thumbnails accessible if they get dropped from the primary cache.</description>

      <description>Much of the functionality of darktable can be accessed via shortcuts using the keyboard or keyboard/mouse combinations. These shortcuts are user-configurable via the shortcuts tab.
Many important shortcut actions are provided with default key combinations, but most must be manually configured by the user. Any key may be used for a keyboard shortcut, and may be combined with the Shift, Control or Alt modifier keys (or any combination thereof).
When you open the shortcuts tab you are initially presented with a hierarchical list of all actions that can be applied with a keyboard shortcut.</description>
