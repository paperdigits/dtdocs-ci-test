      <description>The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a film roll ‚Äì a kind of virtual folder. Whenever you import images from the filesystem, the images are organized in a film roll whose name is derived from the name of their parent folder. Re-importing a folder will add any new images to the existing film roll; images already present in the film roll are not reimported (though the contents of their XMP sidecar files are reloaded into the library database).</description>

      <description>A collection is a set of images defined by a specific combination of selection criteria. The most basic kind of collection is a film roll, which contains all of the images that have been imported from a specific folder on disk.
You can easily construct other kinds of collections based on various image attributes (Exif data, filename, tags etc.). Multiple criteria can be logically combined to narrow or extend your collection (see collect images).</description>

      <title>thumbnails</title>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/lighttable/digital-asset-management/thumbnails/</guid>
      <description>Each image in the current collection is represented by a thumbnail in the lighttable view and filmstrip module. A cache of the last recently used thumbnails is stored in a file on disk and loaded into memory at startup. The size of this cache can be adjusted in preferences &amp;gt; cpu/gpu/memory.
üîóthumbnail creation Thumbnails are created whenever an image is imported into darktable for the first time, after an image has been modified in the darkroom, or when revisiting an image whose thumbnail is no longer available.</description>

      <description>Star ratings and color labels help you to sort and rank images according to your own criteria. An image&amp;rsquo;s star rating and its color labels can be displayed over thumbnails in the lighttable view and filmstrip module.
üîóstar ratings You can give an image a rating from zero to five stars. The quality criteria which lead to a rating are up to you. Whenever you import images, each image receives a default rating which you can define in preferences &amp;gt; import.</description>

      <title>image grouping</title>

      <description>Grouping images helps to improve the structure and clarity of your image collection when displayed in lighttable view.
You can combine images into a group by selecting them and clicking the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù button in the selected image(s) module, or by pressing Ctrl+G. Likewise, you can remove selected images from a group by clicking the ‚Äúungroup‚Äù button, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G. Images generated by duplicating an existing image are automatically grouped. Similarly, if you import multiple images with the same base name, but different extensions (eg.</description>

      <title>metadata and tagging</title>
      <link>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/lighttable/digital-asset-management/metadata-tagging/</link>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/lighttable/digital-asset-management/metadata-tagging/</guid>
      <description>darktable allows you to store additional information about your images to allow them to be more easily searched and grouped. This information is stored in darktable&amp;rsquo;s database and XMP sidecar files and can also be included within exported images.
üîómetadata Metadata (e.g. title, description) is free-format text that usually differs for each image.
See the metadata editor module for details of how to add metadata to images.
üîótagging Tags are usually shared between multiple images and are used to categorise and group them.</description>
