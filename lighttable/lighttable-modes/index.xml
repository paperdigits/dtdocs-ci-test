      <description>The zoomable lighttable mode provides a different way to navigate large collections of images.
üîócontrols  zoom Scroll with the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the lighttable (compared to Ctrl+scroll in filemanager mode). Zooming the thumbnails does not change the number of thumbnails per row, so the lighttable can exceed the visible area on all sides. navigate Hold down the left mouse button to drag the images around on the lighttable to navigate through your collection.</description>

      <description>Culling mode allows you to display images side by side to easily compare them.
üîócontrols  zoom In culling mode, you can zoom into images (up to 100%) by holding Ctrl while scrolling with the mouse wheel. Pan within zoomed images with click+drag. By default, zooming and panning are synchronized between all visible images. If you want to zoom or pan only a specific image, add the Shift modifier to the above actions.</description>

      <description>From any of the lighttable modes, you can display a fully zoomed preview of the image that is currently under the mouse pointer by pressing and holding down W. This is useful to more closely inspect an image while rating and selecting images.
Pressing and holding Ctrl+W fully zooms into the image and also identifies any regions of sharpness in the image that may indicate the image is in focus. For this tool to work the input image needs to hold an embedded JPEG thumbnail, which is the case for most raw files.</description>
