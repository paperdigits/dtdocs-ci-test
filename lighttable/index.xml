      <description>The lighttable view allows you to view and manage your image collection.
The centre view contains thumbnails of your images &amp;ndash; how they are displayed depends on which mode you are working in.
While the mouse is over an image thumbnail or images are selected, there are a number of actions you can perform:
0 â€“ 5 set the rating of the image if an image has 1 star and you hit the 1 key, the image will become unrated R rate the image as &amp;quot;rejected&amp;quot; F1 â€“ F5 set a color label Ctrl+C copy the history stack Ctrl+V paste the copied history stack D open in darkroom view for developing W fully zoom into the current image while the key is pressed Ctrl+W fully zoom into the current image and show areas in focus </description>

      <description>Most changes made within the lighttable are recorded and can be reverted to a previous state. This includes modifications to color labels, ratings, geo-localization, tags, metadata, orientation, copy/paste of history, image duplication, or application of a style. Note that the facility to undo/redo actions is unlimited in the number of steps while in the lighttable view, but it is reset each time you switch to a different view.
Press Ctrl+Z to undo the last modification and Ctrl+Y to redo the last undone modification (if any).</description>
